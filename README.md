\*\*Virtual Environment
It is highly recommended you use virtual environment to isolate dependencies needed per project

\*_On Mac_

```commandline
 python3 -m venv venv  creates the virtual environment folder
 . venv/bin/activate   activates your virtual environment
 pip install flask   pip install dependency_name install the dependency you need
 pip freeze > requirements.txt packages all the dependencies needed to a file.
```

\*_Environment Variables_
Creating a .env file to "hide" your credentials is also recommended.
You do NOT want to push these to a version control system

```commandline
.env file - create this. then add your variables and values. Leave no spaces
```
